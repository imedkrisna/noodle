# This is a repository for graphs and tables of Amanta & Gupta (Work in Progress) aka the noodle paper.

Data to recreate the figures & tables are included in this repo. There are only two r scripts needed to run respectively: `grafik.R` and `trade.R`. The used tables & figures are in the folder named `fig`. Only fig 5 is created with python, ie., `wits_indomi.ipynb`.
